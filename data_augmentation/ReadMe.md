## In this assignment you will have to train CNN models to solve binary classification problems. Your input data is spectrograms generated from audio files. Main purpose of the assignment is to extend your dataset using noise generators, filtering and other techniques you find useful.
## Constraints:

Your are not allowed to change any Neural Network parameters or training parameters (except for INPUT SHAPE, EPOCHS, BATCH_SIZE, steps_per_epoch and validation_steps),

Your are not allowed to use any additional training data or pre-trained models;
