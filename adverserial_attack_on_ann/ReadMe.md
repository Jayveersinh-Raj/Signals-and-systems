# Main Idea
## Imagine, if you get access to some smart speaker. Your task here is to ‘confuse’ or ‘fool’ Artificial Neural Network, which classifies audio data from spectrograms. In order not to expose yourself prematurely, you can modify only 15% of packages (in our case timesteps) in each recording. Try to manipulate test data and get lowest evaluation metrics for the Artificial Neural Network I prepared for you.
